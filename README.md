# 200 OK ...


I wanted to have a "Angular" style page routing on a hostless site

<http://200â„¢.ml> for instance.


### Options:

1. have a use google's dirty trick : "#!" in the url
2. use 200.html and redirects : [netlify.toml][2]
3. on apache : [apache.conf][3]
3. on civetweb : use a [404.cgi][4] script (read more: [issues 551][5])


[1]: gdtrick.html
[2]: netlify.toml
[3]: apache.conf
[4]: 404.html
[5]: https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/issues/551
